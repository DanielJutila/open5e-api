You can use a bonus action to speak this magic weapon's command word, causing its head to glow red-hot. While red-hot, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The weapon's anvil-like head remains red-hot until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the weapon.
