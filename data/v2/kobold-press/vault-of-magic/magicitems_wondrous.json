Each target must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 psychic damage and is frightened of you for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened. If a target dies from this damage or while frightened, the otherworldly spirits within the idol are temporarily sated, and you don't suffer the effects of the idol's Otherworldly Whispers property at the next dusk. Once used, this property of the idol can't be used again until the next dusk.\n- You can use an action to cast the augury spell from the idol. The idol can't be used this way again until the next dusk.",

The bronze fittings are etched with arcane symbols, and the glass parts of the alembic sometimes emit bright, amethyst sparks. If a magic item is placed inside the alembic and a fire lit beneath it, the magic item dissolves and its magical energy drains into the smaller container. Artifacts, legendary magic items, and any magic item that won't physically fit into the alembic (anything larger than a shortsword or a cloak) can't be dissolved in this way. Full dissolution and distillation of an item's magical energy takes 1 hour, but 10 minutes is enough time to render most items nonmagical. If an item spends a full hour dissolving in the alembic, its magical energy coalesces in the smaller container as a lump of material resembling gray-purple, stiff dough known as arcanoplasm. This material is safe to handle and easy to incorporate into new magic items. Using arcanoplasm while creating a magic item reduces the cost of the new item by 10 percent per degree of rarity of the magic item that was distilled into the arcanoplasm. An alembic of unmaking can distill or disenchant one item per 24 hours.",

You can use an action to pull the spiky object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a 1d8 and consulting the below table. The creature is a bramble version (see sidebar) of the beast listed in the table. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. Once three spiky objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn. Alternatively, one willing animal companion or familiar can be placed in the bag for 1 week. A non-beast animal companion or familiar that is placed in the bag is treated as if it had been placed into a bag of holding and can be removed from the bag at any time. A beast animal companion or familiar disappears once placed in the bag, and the bag's magic is dormant until the week is up. At the end of the week, the animal companion or familiar exits the bag as a bramble creature (see the template in the sidebar) and can be returned to its original form only with a wish. The creature retains its status as an animal companion or familiar after its transformation and can choose to activate or deactivate its Thorn Body trait as a bonus action. A transformed familiar can be re-summoned with the find familiar spell. Once the bag has been used to change an animal companion or familiar into a bramble creature, it becomes an ordinary, nonmagical bag. | 1d8 | Creature |\n| --- | ------------ |\n| 1 | Weasel |\n| 2 | Giant rat |\n| 3 | Badger |\n| 4 | Boar |\n| 5 | Panther |\n| 6 | Giant badger | Only a beast can become a bramble creature.

This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. It dies if this reduces its hit point maximum to 0. You can expend the charges in up to 5 blood marks as part of the same action. To replenish an expended charge in a blood mark, a humanoid must pledge a pint of their blood in a 10-minute ritual that involves letting a drop of their blood fall through the center of the coin. The drop disappears in the process and the center fills with a red glow. There is no limit to how much blood a humanoid may pledge, but each coin can hold only 1 charge. To pledge more, the humanoid must perform the ritual on another blood mark. Any person foolish enough to pledge more than a single blood coin might find the coins all redeemed at once, since such redemptions often happen at great blood feasts held by vampires and other undead.",

When you consume a dose, your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are reduced by 1 each. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest. You can consume up to three doses as part of casting a spell, and you can choose to affect your spell with one of the following options for each dose you consumed: - If the spell is of the abjuration school, increase the save DC by 2.\n- If the spell has more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, treat the spell's effects as if you had cast the spell at one slot level higher than the spell slot you used.\n- The spell is affected by one of the following metamagic options, even if you aren't a sorcerer: heightened, quickened, or subtle. A spell can't be affected by the same option more than once, though you can affect one spell with up to three different options. If you consume one or more doses without casting a spell, you can choose to instead affect a spell you cast before you finish a long rest. In addition, consuming blue rose gives you some protection against spells. When a spellcaster you can see casts a spell, you can use your reaction to cause one of the following:\n- You have advantage on the saving throw against the spell if it is a spell of the abjuration school.\n- If the spell is counterspell or dispel magic, the DC increases by 2 to interrupt your spellcasting or to end a magic effect on you. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to the number of doses you consumed. At the end of each long rest, you must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, your Hit Dice maximum is reduced by 25 percent. This reduction affects only the number of Hit Dice you can use to regain hit points during a short rest; it doesn't reduce your hit point maximum. This reduction lasts until you recover from the addiction. If you have no remaining Hit Dice to lose, you suffer one level of exhaustion, and your Hit Dice are returned to 75 percent of your maximum Hit Dice. The process then repeats until you die from exhaustion or you recover from the addiction. On a successful save, your exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces your level of exhaustion below 1, you recover from the addiction. A greater restoration spell or similar magic ends the addiction and its effects. Consuming at least one dose of blue rose again halts the effects of the addiction for 2 days, at which point you can consume another dose of blue rose to halt it again or the effects of the addiction continue as normal.",

Its covers often reflect light as if it were resting in a forest grove, and some owners swear that a goblin face appears on them now and again. The sturdy lock on one side opens only for wizards, elves, and Shadow Fey (see Tome of Beasts). The book has 15 charges, and it regains 2d6 + 3 expended charges daily in the twilight before dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a 1d20. On a 1, the book retains its Ebon Tides and Shadow Lore properties but loses its Spells property. When the magic ritual completes, make an Intelligence (Arcana) check and consult the Terrain Changes table for the appropriate DCs. You can change the terrain in any one way listed at your result or lower. For example, if your result was 17, you could turn a small forest up to 30 feet across into a grassland, create a grove of trees up to 240 feet across, create a 6-foot-wide flowing stream, overgrow 1,500 feet of an existing road, or other similar option. Only natural terrain you can see can be affected; built structures, such as homes or castles, remain untouched, though roads and trails can be overgrown or hidden. On a failure, the terrain is unchanged. On a 1, an Overshadow (see Tome of Beasts 2) also appears and attacks you. On a 20, you can choose two options. Deities, Fey Lords and Ladies (see Tome of Beasts), archdevils, demon lords, and other powerful rulers in the Plane of Shadow can prevent these terrain modifications from happening in their presence or anywhere within their respective domains. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) can be found in Deep Magic for 5th Edition. At the GM's discretion, spells from Deep Magic for 5th Edition can be replaced with other spells of similar levels and similarly related to darkness, illusion, or shadows, such as invisibility or major image. | DC | Effect |\n| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 8 | Obscuring a path and removing all signs of passage (30 feet per point over 7) |\n| 10 | Creating a grove of trees (30 feet across per point over 9) |\n| 11 | Creating or drying up a lake or pond (up to 10 feet across per point over 10) |\n| 12 | Creating a flowing stream (1 foot wide per point over 11) |\n| 13 | Overgrowing an existing road with brush or trees (300 feet per point over 12) |\n| 14 | Shifting a river to a new course (300 feet per point over 13) |\n| 15 | Moving a forest (300 feet per point over 14) |\n| 16 | Creating a small hill, riverbank, or cliff (10 feet tall per point over 15) |\n| 17 | Turning a small forest into grassland or clearing, or vice versa (30 feet across per point over 16) |\n| 18 | Creating a new river (10 feet wide per point over 17) |\n| 19 | Turning a large forest into grassland, or vice versa (300 feet across per point over 19) |\n| 20 | Creating a new mountain (1,000 feet high per point over 19) |\n| 21 | Drying up an existing river (reducing width by 10 feet per point over 20) |\n| 22 | Shrinking an existing hill or mountain (reducing 1,000 feet per point over 21) | Written by an elvish princess at the Court of Silver Words, this volume encodes her understanding and mastery of shadow.

If you hit a creature of your size or smaller using a claw, you automatically grapple the creature with the claw. You can have no more than two creatures grappled in this way at a time. While grappling a target with a claw, you can't attack other creatures with that claw. While wearing the gloves, you have disadvantage on Charisma and Dexterity checks, but you have advantage on checks while operating an apparatus of the crab and on attack rolls with the apparatus' claws. In addition, you can't wield weapons or a shield, and you can't cast a spell that has a somatic component. A creature with an Intelligence of 8 or higher that has two claws can wear these gloves. If it does so, it has two appropriately sized humanoid hands instead of claws. The creature can wield weapons with the hands and has advantage on Dexterity checks that require fine manipulation. Pulling the gloves on or off requires an action.",

Each object is always small enough to fit in a single hand and is never worth more than 1,000 gp. The GM determines the type and value of each object. Once the left eye of an ornate and magical statue of a pit fiend revered by a small cult of Mammon, this exquisite purple gem was pried from the idol by an adventurer named Slick Finnigan. Slick and his companions had taken it upon themselves to eradicate the cult, eager for the accolades they would receive for defeating an evil in the community. The loot they stood to gain didn't hurt either. After the assault, while his companions were busy chasing the fleeing members of the cult, Slick pocketed the gem, disfiguring the statue and weakening its power in the process. He was then attacked by a cultist who had managed to evade notice by the adventurers. Slick escaped with his life, and the gem, but was unable to acquire the second eye. Within days, the thief was finding himself assaulted by devils and cultists. He quickly offloaded his loot with a collection of merchants in town, including a jeweler who was looking for an exquisite stone to use in a piece commissioned by a local noble. Slick then set off with his pockets full of coin, happily leaving the devilish drama behind. This magical amulet attracts the attention of worshippers of Mammon, who can almost sense its presence and are eager to claim its power for themselves, though a few extremely devout members of the weakened cult wish to return the gem to its original place in the idol. Due to this, and a bit of bad luck, this amulet has changed hands many times over the decades.",

A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check convinces an unwilling beast to board the vessel, though it remains uneasy and skittish while aboard. \nCursed Crew. When this baleful flag flies atop the mast of a waterborne vehicle, it curses the vessel and all those that board it. When a creature that isn’t a humanoid dies aboard the vessel, it rises 1 minute later as a zombie under the ship captain’s control. When a humanoid dies aboard the vessel, it rises 1 minute later as a ghoul under the ship captain’s control. A ghoul retains any knowledge of sailing or maintaining a waterborne vehicle that it had in life. \nCursed Captain. If the ship flying this flag doesn’t have a captain, the undead crew seeks out a powerful humanoid or intelligent undead to bring aboard and coerce into becoming the captain. When an undead with an Intelligence of 10 or higher boards the captainless vehicle, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become magically bound to the ship and the flag. If the creature exits the vessel and boards it again, the creature must repeat the saving throw. The flag fills the captain with the desire to attack other vessels to grow its crew and commandeer larger vessels when possible, bringing the flag with it. If the flag is destroyed or removed from a waterborne vehicle for at least 7 days, the zombie and ghoul crew crumbles to dust, and the captain is freed of the flag’s magic, if the captain was bound to it. \nUnholy Vessel. While aboard a vessel flying this flag, an undead creature has advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead, and if it fails the saving throw, it isn’t destroyed, no matter its CR. In addition, the captain and crew can’t be frightened while aboard a vessel flying this flag. \nWhen a creature that isn’t a construct or undead and isn’t part of the crew boards the vessel, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned while it remains on board. If the creature exits the vessel and boards it again, the creature must repeat the saving throw.",

They are recognizable by their black, hooded robes, silver masks, and the rods they carry as weapons. These stern sentinels are overseen by The Magister, a powerful wizard of whom little is known other than their title. The Magister has made it their duty to oversee order in the city and executes their plans through the Justicars, giving them the Magister's mark, a signet ring, as a symbol of their authority. While some officers and members of the watch may be resentful of the Justicars' presence, many are grateful for their aid, especially in situations that could require magic. Justicar's are a small, elite group, typically acting as solo agents, though extremely dangerous situations bring them together in pairs or larger groups as needed. The Justicars are outfitted with three symbols of authority that are also imbued with power: their masks, rods, and rings. Each by itself is a useful item, but they are made stronger when worn together. The combined powers of this trinity of items make a Justicar a formidable force in the pursuit of law and order.",

On a hit, the stake attaches to a vampire's chest. At the end of the vampire's next turn, roots force their way into the vampire's heart, negating fast healing and preventing gaseous form. If the vampire is reduced to 0 hit points while the stake is attached to it, it is immobilized as if it had been staked. A creature can take its action to remove the stake by succeeding on a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check. If it is removed from the vampire's chest, the stake is destroyed. The stake has no effect on targets other than vampires.",

            "desc": "Legends tell of a dragon whose hide was impenetrable and so tenacious that only a blow to the heart would kill it. An unnamed hero finally defeated it and tore its heart into two. The dragon's name was lost, but its legacy remains. This magic amulet is one of two items that were crafted to hold its heart. An intricate engraving of a warrior's sword piercing a dragon's chest is detailed along the front of this untarnished silver locket. Within the locket is a clear crystal vial with a pulsing piece of a dragon's heart. The pulses become more frequent when you are close to death. Attuning to the locket requires you to mix your blood with the blood within the vial. The vial holds 3 charges of dragon blood that are automatically expended when you reach certain health thresholds. The locket regains 1 expended charge for each vial of dragon blood you place in the vial inside the locket up to a maximum of 3 charges. For the purpose of this locket, “dragon” refers to any creature with the dragon type, including drakes and wyverns. While wearing or carrying the locket, you gain the following effects: - When you reach 0 hit points, but do not die outright, the vial breaks and the dragon heart stops pulsing, rendering the item broken and irreparable. You immediately gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Constitution modifier. If the locket has at least 1 charge of dragon blood, it does not break, but this effect can't be activated again until 3 days have passed. - When you are reduced to half of your maximum hit points, the locket expends 1 charge of dragon blood, and you become immune to any type of blood loss effect, such as the blood loss from a stirge's Blood Drain, for 1d4 + 1 hours. Any existing blood loss effects end immediately when this activates.",

It's a sturdy wooden stave, 6 to 10 feet long, carved with runes that name the dishonored target of the pole's curse. The carved shaft is draped in horsehide, topped with a horse's skull, and placed where its target is expected to pass by. Typically, the pole is driven into the ground or wedged into a rocky cleft in a remote spot where the intended victim won't see it until it's too late. The pole is created to punish a specific person for a specific crime. The exact target must be named on the pole; a generic identity such as “the person who blinded Lars Gustafson” isn't precise enough. The moment the named target approaches within 333 feet, the pole casts bestow curse (with a range of 333 feet instead of touch) on the target. The DC for the target's Wisdom saving throw is 15. If the saving throw is successful, the pole recasts the spell at the end of each round until the saving throw fails, the target retreats out of range, or the pole is destroyed. Anyone other than the pole's creator who tries to destroy or knock down the pole is also targeted by a bestow curse spell, but only once. The effect of the curse is set when the pole is created, and the curse lasts 8 hours without requiring concentration. The pole becomes nonmagical once it has laid its curse on its intended target. An untriggered and forgotten nithing pole remains dangerous for centuries.",

You and your bonded partner each gain the following benefits: - You are proficient in each saving throw that your bonded partner is proficient in.\n- If you are within 5 feet of your bonded partner and you fail a saving throw, your bonded partner can make the saving throw as well. If your bonded partner succeeds, you can choose to succeed on the saving throw that you failed.\n- You can use a bonus action to concentrate on the magical bond between you to determine your bonded partner's status. You become aware of the direction and distance to your bonded partner, whether they are unharmed or wounded, any conditions that may be currently affecting them, and whether or not they are afflicted with an addiction, curse, or disease. If you can see your bonded partner, you automatically know this information just by looking at them.\n- If your bonded partner is wounded, you can use a bonus action to take 4d8 slashing damage, healing your bonded partner for the same amount. If your bonded partner is reduced to 0 hit points, you can do this as a reaction.\n- If you are under the effects of a spell that has a duration but doesn't require concentration, you can use an action to touch your bonded partner to share the effects of the spell with them, splitting the remaining duration (rounded down) between you. For example, if you are affected by the mage armor spell and it has 4 hours remaining, you can use an action to touch your bonded partner to give them the benefits of the mage armor spell, reducing the duration to 2 hours on each of you.\n- If your bonded partner dies, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you drop to 0 hit points. On a success, you are stunned until the end of your next turn by the shock of the bond suddenly being broken.

So long as you carry this stone, you can interact with the creature as if it were still alive, even speaking to it if it is able to speak, though it can't physically interact with the material world. It can gesture to indicate directions and communicate very basic single-word ideas to you telepathically. The stone has a number of charges, depending on the size of the creature stored within it. The stone has 6 charges if the creature is Large or smaller, 10 charges if the creature is Huge, and 12 charges if the creature is Gargantuan. After all of the stone's charges have been used, the beast's spirit is completely drained, and the stone becomes a nonmagical bauble. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to cause one of the following effects:",

While wearing this amulet, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word and expend 1 of its charges to create a brief magical bond with a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically bonded with you until the end of your next turn. While bonded in this way, you can choose to have advantage on attack rolls against the target or cause the target to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.",
