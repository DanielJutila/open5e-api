While wearing this kilt, your Unarmored Defense increases by 1, and you gain additional benefits while raging, depending on the type of kilt you are wearing. Bear Fur (Very Rare).

This kilt empowers your rage with the nimble ferocity of an elk. While raging, if you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon’s type. Wolf Fur (Uncommon). This kilt empowers your rage with the speed of a wolf. While raging, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.",
