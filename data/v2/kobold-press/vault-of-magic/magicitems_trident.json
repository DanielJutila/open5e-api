While holding the trident, you can breathe underwater. The trident has 3 charges for the following other properties. It regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. Call Sealife. While holding the trident, you can use an action to expend 3 of its charges to cast the conjure animals spell from it. The creatures you summon must be beasts that can breathe water. Yearn for the Tide. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the trident, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 charge to force the target to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target must spend its next turn leaping into the nearest body of water and swimming toward the bottom. A creature that can breathe underwater automatically succeeds on the saving throw. If no water is in the targetâ€™s line of sight, the target automatically succeeds on the saving throw.",
