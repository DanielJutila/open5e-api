The doorway must be at least 1 foot wide by 2 feet tall and can be no larger than 5 feet wide by 10 feet tall. Once the door is drawn, place the knob appropriately; it attaches magically to the surface and your drawing becomes a real door to the spell’s destination. The doorway remains functional for the spell’s duration. During that time, anyone can open or close the door and pass through it in either direction. The destination can be on any plane of existence. It must be familiar to you, and your level of familiarity with it determines the accuracy of the spell (determined by the GM). If it’s a place you’ve visited, you can expect 100 percent accuracy. If it’s been described to you by someone who was there, you might arrive in the wrong room or even the wrong structure, depending on how detailed their description was. If you’ve only heard about the destination third-hand, you may end up in a similar structure that’s in a very different locale. Door of the far traveler doesn’t create a doorway at the destination. It connects to an existing, working door. It can’t, for example, take you to an open field or a forest with no structures (unless someone built a doorframe with a door in that spot for this specific purpose!). While the spell is in effect, the pre-existing doorway connects only to the area you occupied while casting the spell. If you connected to an existing doorway between a home’s parlor and library, for example, and your door leads into the library, then people can still walk through that doorway from the parlor into the library normally. Anyone trying to go the other direction, however, arrives wherever you came from instead of in the parlor. Before casting the spell, you must spend one hour etching magical symbols onto the doorknob that will serve as the spell’s material component to attune it to your desired destination. Once prepared, the knob remains attuned to that destination until it’s used or you spend another hour attuning it to a different location. The door of the far traveler is dispelled if you remove the knob from the door. You can do this as a bonus action from either side of the door, provided it’s shut. If the spell’s duration expires naturally, the knob falls to the ground on whichever side of the door you’re on.

If targeting a person, the primary performer must hold a vial of the person’s blood. Over the course of the incantation, the components are mixed and the primary caster inscribes a false history and a sum of knowledge concerning the target into the book using the mockingbird quills. When the incantation is completed, whatever the caster wrote in the book becomes known and accepted as truth by the target. The target can attempt a Wisdom saving throw to negate this effect. If the target was a city or a kingdom, the saving throw is made with advantage by its current leader or ruler. If the saving throw fails, all citizens or members of the target organization or kingdom believe the account written in the book to be fact. Any information contrary to what was written in the book is forgotten within an hour, but individuals who make a sustained study of such information can attempt a Wisdom saving throw to retain the contradictory knowledge. Books containing contradictory information are considered obsolete or purposely misleading. Permanent structures such as statues of heroes who've been written out of existence are believed to be purely artistic endeavors or so old that no one remembers their identities anymore.

You and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can move through the doorway into the realm beyond. For the spell’s duration, the mirror remains anchored in the plane of origin, where it can’t be broken or otherwise damaged by any mundane means. No creatures other than those you designate can pass through the mirror or see into the mirror realm. The realm within the mirror is an exact reflection of the location you left. The temperature is comfortable, and any environmental threats (lava, poisonous gas, etc.) are inert, harmless facsimiles of the real thing. Likewise, magic items reflected in the mirror realm have no magical properties, but those carried into it work normally. Food, drink, and other beneficial items within the mirror realm (reflections of originals in the real world) function as normal, real items; food can be eaten, wine can be drunk, and so on. Only items that were reflected in the mirror at the moment the spell was cast exist inside the mirror realm. Items placed in front of the mirror afterward don’t appear in the mirror realm, and creatures never do unless they are allowed in by you. Items found in the mirror realm dissolve into nothingness when they leave it, but the effects of food and drink remain. Sound passes through the mirror in both directions. Creatures in the mirror realm can see what’s happening in the world, but creatures in the world see only what the mirror reflects. Objects can cross the mirror boundary only while worn or carried by a creature, and spells can’t cross it at all. You can’t stand in the mirror realm and shoot arrows or cast spells at targets in the world or vice versa. The boundaries of the mirror realm are the same as the room or location in the plane of origin, but the mirror realm can’t exceed 50,000 square feet (for simplicity, imagine 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on a side). If the original space is larger than this, such as an open field or a forest, the boundary is demarcated with an impenetrable, gray fog. Any creature still inside the mirror realm when the spell ends is expelled through the mirror into the nearest empty space. If this spell is cast in the same spot every day for a year, it becomes permanent. Once permanent, the mirror can’t be moved or destroyed through mundane means. You can allow new creatures into the mirror realm (and disallow previous creatures) by recasting the spell within range of the permanent mirror. Casting the spell elsewhere doesn’t affect the creation or the existence of a permanent mirror realm; a determined spellcaster could have multiple permanent mirror realms to use as storage spaces, hiding spots, and spy vantages.",

The portion of your plane that’s inside the bubble swaps places with a corresponding portion of the plane your music box is attuned with. There is a 10% chance that the portion of the plane you summon arrives with native creatures on it. Inanimate objects and non-ambulatory life (like trees) are cut off at the edge of the bubble, while living creatures that don’t fit inside the bubble are shunted outside of it before the swap occurs. Otherwise, creatures from both planes that are caught inside the bubble are sent along with their chunk of reality to the other plane for the duration of the spell unless they make a successful Charisma saving throw when the spell is cast; with a successful save, a creature can choose whether to shift planes with the bubble or leap outside of it a moment before the shift occurs. Any natural reaction between the two planes occurs normally (fire spreads, water flows, etc.) while energy (such as necrotic energy) leaks slowly across the edge of the sphere (no more than a foot or two per hour). Otherwise, creatures and effects can move freely across the boundary of the sphere; for the duration of the spell, it becomes a part of its new location to the fullest extent possible, given the natures of the two planes. The two displaced bubbles shift back to their original places automatically after 24 hours. Note that the amount of preparation involved (acquiring and attuning the music box) precludes this spell from being cast on the spur of the moment.
