If at least one creature failed the saving throw, the primal essence of the Lower Planes within the globe coalesces into a fiend, depending on the type of globe.

This globe deals 2d6 psychic damage and summons a dretch or a lemure (your choice) on a failed saving throw. Primal Doom of Pain (Rare). This globe deals 4d6 psychic damage and summons a barbed devil or vrock (your choice) on a failed saving throw. Primal Doom of Rage (Very Rare). This globe deals 6d6 psychic damage and summons a bone devil or glabrezu (your choice) on a failed saving throw.",
