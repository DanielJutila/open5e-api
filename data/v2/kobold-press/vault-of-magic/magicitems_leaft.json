While wearing this armor in forest terrain, you have advantage on\nStrength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. You can use an action to transform the armor into a cloud of swirling razor-sharp leaves, and each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 slashing damage. For 1 minute, the cloud of leaves spreads out in a 10-foot radius from you, making the area lightly obscured for creatures other than you. The cloud moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the cloud and ends the effect. While the armor is transformed, you don't gain a base Armor Class from the armor. The armor can't be used this way again until the next dawn.",
