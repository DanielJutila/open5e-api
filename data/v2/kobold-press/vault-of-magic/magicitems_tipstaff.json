The weapon has 5 charges, and it regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature with a melee attack with this magic weapon, you can expend 1 charge to force the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the creature took 20 damage or more from this attack, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.",
